          <h1><a name="ubuntu" class="anchor" href="#ubuntu"></a>Installation on Ubuntu, Debian and derivatives</h1>
          <p>Official repositories of these distributions contain and old package, the version 0.7 which presents many issues caused from serious changes in espeak and MBROLA.</p>
          <p>It's possible to download the <strong>deb</strong> package from the <a href="download.html">Download</a> page and install it using:<br />
          <code>cd "~/folder with the downloaded file"<br />
            sudo dpkg -i "file name.deb"</code></p>
          
          <h1><a name="archlinux" class="anchor" href="#archlinux"></a>Installation on Arch Linux and derivatives</h1>
          <p>In the AUR you can find the latest available version, it can be downloaded and built using yaourt (or a similar AUR helper) using <code>yaourt -S gespeaker</code>
            and then following the AUR helper instructions.</p> 
          <p>For anyone which doesn't want to use AUR the <strong>tar.xz</strong> package can be downloaded from the <a href="download.html">Download</a> page and installed using:<br />
            <code>cd "~/folder with the downloaded file"<br />
            sudo pacman -U "file name.pkg.tar.xz"</code></p>

          <h1><a name="source" class="anchor" href="#source"></a>Installation from source code</h1>
          <p>If the prebuilt package will not be available for your distribution you can use the source code package to install Gespeaker using:<br />
            <code>cd "~/folder with the downloaded file"<br />
            mkdir gespeaker-install<br />
            tar xvzf "file name.pkg.tar.gz" -C gespeaker-install<br />
            cd gespeaker-install/gespeaker-*<br />
            python2 setup.py build<br />
            sudo python2 setup.py install</code></p>
          <p>After the installation, if no errors were reported the folder gespeaker-install can be removed from root or via <code>sudo rm -rf "gespeaker-install"</code> and the same for the downloaded source package.</p>
          <p><strong>Warning!</strong> After executing the manual installation from source code an automatic software uninstall will not be possibile but you will have to manually
            delete all the installed files that were reported during the last installation step.</p>
